# Pharos Shield

**A transaction-and-contract integrity layer for Pharos.** Three composable
commands — `simulate`, `autopsy`, `inspect` — that answer:

> *Will this transaction do what I expect, or why did it fail?*
> *What is this contract, and who controls it?*

Pharos Shield operates at the **transaction-execution and contract-control
layer**. It is **not** a token rug/honeypot/tax scanner — that is a different
problem. Shield verifies what a transaction *does* and what a contract *is*,
from on-chain facts only.

> **Honesty first.** Shield reports facts it verified ("no EIP-1967 proxy
> detected; admin slot = 0x…; simulation would revert: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT").
> It never shows an unverifiable green "SAFE" badge. Over-claiming safety is
> worse than no tool.

- **Network:** Pharos mainnet (Pacific Ocean), **chain ID 1672** — the default
  and the network of **every example and output below**. Testnet (688688) is a
  secondary toggle only.
- **No mocks anywhere.** Every example in this README is a real mainnet RPC call
  against a real contract/transaction. The hashes and addresses are live.

## Install (one step — or just tell your agent)

You don't need to run anything by hand. In Claude Code (or any agent CLI with a
shell), just say:

> **"Install this skill: https://github.com/Jennycruzy/pharos-shield"**

The agent clones the repo and runs the installer below. It then registers the
MCP server and installs the skill, so from your next session you talk to Shield
in plain English — no commands.

**The installer** (what the agent runs; you can run it too):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jennycruzy/pharos-shield
cd pharos-shield
bash install.sh
```

`install.sh` is idempotent and does three things:
1. `npm install` in `pharos-shield/` (this also compiles `dist/`).
2. Registers the MCP server with Claude Code (user scope) — your
   natural-language interface (`shield_inspect/autopsy/simulate/probe`).
3. Installs the agent skill into `~/.claude/skills/pharos-shield`.

Open a **new** session (MCP tools load at startup), then just ask:
*"is `0x3c22…cf62` a proxy and who can upgrade it?"* — the agent calls the right
tool and answers with on-chain facts. Other CLIs: `cd pharos-shield && npm run setup`
prints ready-to-paste config. Full details in
[Using Shield from an AI agent (MCP)](#using-shield-from-an-ai-agent-mcp).

## Why Shield exists

On a fast L1, the two most expensive moments are **right before you sign** and
**right after something failed**. Block explorers tell you a transaction
reverted; they rarely tell you *which inner call* reverted or *why* in a way you
can act on. And before you interact with a contract, you usually have no idea
whether it is a proxy whose logic can be swapped out from under you.

Shield closes those three gaps with on-chain primitives that Pharos exposes
(`debug_traceCall`, `debug_traceTransaction` with `callTracer`,
`eth_getStorageAt`, `eth_getCode`):

| Moment | Question | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before signing | "Will this revert? What will it move?" | `simulate` |
| After a failure | "Why did this fail, and where?" | `autopsy` |
| Before trusting a contract | "Is this a proxy? Who can upgrade it?" | `inspect` |

Everything it returns is a **fact it verified**, never a safety score.

---

## Which command do I want?

Map your phrasing to a command (this is also how an AI agent should route):

| If you're asking… | Use | Input you need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Will this transaction work / revert?" | `simulate` | `from`, `to`, `data` |
| "What would this call actually do before I sign?" | `simulate` | `from`, `to`, `data`, `value` |
| "Why did my transaction fail?" | `autopsy` | a tx hash |
| "Did this tx actually fail, or did it succeed?" | `autopsy` | a tx hash |
| "Which inner call reverted in this complex tx?" | `autopsy` | a tx hash |
| "Is this address a contract or just a wallet?" | `inspect` | an address |
| "Is this contract a proxy? What's the implementation?" | `inspect` | an address |
| "Who can upgrade this contract?" | `inspect` | an address |

---

## Install & quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jennycruzy/pharos-shield
cd pharos-shield/pharos-shield
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # optional; defaults already target mainnet
npm run cli -- probe          # confirm network + live trace capability
```

Three commands, one line each:

```bash
npm run cli -- inspect  0x3c2269811836af69497e5f486a85d7316753cf62
npm run cli -- autopsy  0xdeeb262fad28864a8e031db91e99de0bb4bd42aff936876d577adcddcf0de3ff
npm run cli -- simulate --from 0xYou --to 0xContract --data 0x70a08231...
```

Global flags:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON instead of formatted text |
| `--network mainnet\|testnet` | Override `PHAROS_NETWORK` for this one run |

As an **Agent Skill**, copy the directory into your agent's skills folder:

```bash
cp -r pharos-shield ~/.claude/skills/pharos-shield      # Claude
cp -r pharos-shield ~/.codex/skills/pharos-shield       # Codex
# or:  npx skills add <path-or-repo>
```

`SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` ship in the directory for cross-agent
discovery. The MCP server (below) covers agents that consume tools rather than
skills.

---

## Skill installation (file-only)

The skill is **file-only and small** — nine TypeScript modules (≈1,727 lines)
plus the manifests, about **70 KB** tracked source (the 60 KB `package-lock.json`
and `node_modules/` are runtime concerns, not part of the skill payload). There
is no build step to ship: the CLI and MCP server run directly via `tsx`.

**Natural-language prompt for an agent.** Drop this into an agent that supports
skills and it will pull and register Shield:

> "Install the `pharos-shield` skill from
> `github.com/Jennycruzy/pharos-shield` (path `pharos-shield/`). It adds
> three commands — `simulate`, `autopsy`, `inspect` — for verifying Pharos
> mainnet transactions and contracts."

**Sparse, blobless checkout** (pulls only the skill directory, not history):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse \
  https://github.com/Jennycruzy/pharos-shield shield-tmp
cd shield-tmp
git sparse-checkout set pharos-shield
cp -r pharos-shield ~/.claude/skills/pharos-shield      # or ~/.codex/skills, ~/.openclaw/skills
```

Skill **install** (the manifests + scripts) is separate from **runtime setup**
(`npm install` inside the copied directory, needed only when you actually run a
command). An agent can read `SKILL.md` without ever installing dependencies.

---

## Workspace pull without clone

If you'd rather attach the repo to an existing working directory without a full
`git clone`:

```bash
mkdir pharos-shield && cd pharos-shield
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Jennycruzy/pharos-shield
git fetch --depth 1 origin main
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
cd pharos-shield && npm install        # only when you want to run commands
```

---

## `inspect` — control structure

**What it does.** Classifies an address as contract or EOA (`eth_getCode`),
then reads the three EIP-1967 storage slots (implementation / admin / beacon)
plus the legacy OpenZeppelin slot to determine whether it is a proxy and what
its upgrade authority looks like — purely from storage.

```
pharos-shield inspect <address> [--json]
```

### Use cases

- **Pre-interaction due diligence.** Before approving or swapping against a
  contract, find out if it's an upgradeable proxy. A non-zero admin slot means
  someone can replace the logic you're trusting.
- **Centralization check.** Identify *who* (which address) holds upgrade
  authority via the EIP-1967 admin slot — a key input for risk assessment.
- **Typo / scam guard.** Confirm a "token contract" address actually has
  bytecode. An EOA masquerading as a token (or a mistyped address) shows up as
  `kind: eoa` immediately.
- **Protocol mapping.** Walk a protocol's proxies to chart which implementation
  each one currently points at.

### Real example — an EIP-1967 proxy

```text
$ npm run cli -- inspect 0x3c2269811836af69497e5f486a85d7316753cf62
Address:   0x3c2269811836af69497E5F486A85D7316753cf62  (mainnet)
Kind:      contract (2304 bytes of code)
Proxy:     yes (eip1967)
Impl:      0x4EE2F9B7cf3A68966c370F3eb2C16613d3235245
Admin:     0x9740FF91F1985D8d2B71494aE1A2f723bb3Ed9E4
Upgrade:   inferred from the EIP-1967 admin slot: 0x9740FF91F1985D8d2B71494aE1A2f723bb3Ed9E4
           can upgrade this proxy. (Inferred from storage, NOT from verified source.)
Facts:
  - EIP-1967 implementation slot is non-zero -> proxy. Implementation = 0x4EE2F9B7...
  - EIP-1967 admin slot = 0x9740FF91... (controls upgrades).
```

**How to read it:** this contract delegates all logic to
`0x4EE2F9B7…`, and `0x9740FF91…` is the only address that can repoint it. If
that admin is an EOA, one key controls the contract's behavior.

### Real example — an EOA and a non-proxy contract

```text
$ npm run cli -- inspect 0x7Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C
Kind:      eoa
Facts:
  - eth_getCode returned 0x: no contract deployed at this address.

$ npm run cli -- inspect 0x52c48d4213107b20bc583832b0d951fb9ca8f0b0
Kind:      contract (3249 bytes of code)
Proxy:     no
Upgrade:   no proxy slots set — no upgrade mechanism provable from storage.
```

### Deep control-structure reads

Beyond the storage slots, `inspect` adds live and static signals — each reported
only when the chain actually answers:

- **Live trait reads (`eth_call`):** `owner()` / `getOwner()`, `paused()`, and a
  UUPS-style `implementation()` — surfaced only on a clean decodable return.
- **Beacon resolution:** for a beacon proxy, calls `beacon.implementation()` to
  resolve the *real* current implementation the beacon points at.
- **EIP-1167 minimal-proxy detection:** recognizes the 45-byte minimal-proxy
  bytecode shape (independent of the EIP-1967 slots) and extracts its delegate
  target.
- **Bytecode static analysis (PUSH-aware):** reports whether the deployed code
  contains `DELEGATECALL`, `SELFDESTRUCT`, or `CREATE2` — facts about the code,
  not judgments. The scan skips PUSH immediates so pushed data can't masquerade
  as an opcode.
- **Token metadata + ERC-165:** `name`/`symbol`/`decimals`/`totalSupply` when the
  contract is a token, and the ERC-165 interfaces it declares (after the
  `0x01ffc9a7`/`0xffffffff` compliance handshake, so non-ERC-165 contracts aren't
  misreported).

Real example — the EIP-1967 proxy now resolves its owner and confirms the
delegate mechanism from bytecode:

```text
$ npm run cli -- inspect 0x3c2269811836af69497e5f486a85d7316753cf62
Proxy:     yes (eip1967)
Impl:      0x4EE2F9B7cf3A68966c370F3eb2C16613d3235245
Admin:     0x9740FF91F1985D8d2B71494aE1A2f723bb3Ed9E4
Owner:     0x9F403140Bc0574D7d36eA472b82DAa1Bbd4eF327 (live owner())
Bytecode:  contains DELEGATECALL

$ npm run cli -- inspect 0x52c48d4213107b20bc583832b0d951fb9ca8f0b0
Token:     Wrapped PROS (WPROS), decimals 18
```

### What it can and cannot prove

- **Can prove (from storage):** contract vs EOA; EIP-1967 implementation, admin,
  and beacon slots; legacy OZ implementation slot; EIP-1167 minimal-proxy shape;
  therefore whether it's a proxy and which address the admin slot names.
- **Can read live (when the contract answers):** `owner`/`paused`, UUPS
  `implementation`, beacon implementation, token metadata, ERC-165 interfaces,
  and which notable opcodes the bytecode contains.
- **Cannot prove (no public source API on Pharos):** verified source code, the
  human owner behind an admin address, or UUPS upgrade logic gated inside the
  implementation. These are reported as **inferred/live-read**, never as verified
  source.

---

## `autopsy` — post-failure forensics

**What it does.** Pulls the transaction and receipt. If it succeeded, it says so
plainly. If it failed, it traces the tx with `callTracer`, descends to the
**deepest reverting call** (the true origin — parents just propagate the error),
decodes the revert payload, and states a trace-supported probable cause.

```
pharos-shield autopsy <txhash> [--json]
```

### Use cases

- **"Why did my swap/transfer fail?"** Get the actual revert string instead of a
  generic "failed" badge.
- **Triage by category.** Shield maps decoded reverts to honest causes —
  allowance/approval, insufficient balance, slippage/minOut, paused/frozen,
  deadline expired, arithmetic panic, out-of-gas — *only when the revert text
  supports it*. Otherwise it says **cause undetermined** rather than guess.
- **Locate the failing hop in a multi-call tx.** Router → pair → token chains
  fail several layers deep; autopsy names the exact `from → to [selector]` frame
  that reverted.
- **Bot / automation post-mortems.** Feed a failed tx hash straight into the
  pipeline (`--json`) and branch on `revert.kind` or `probableCause`.

### Real example — decoded `Error(string)`

```text
$ npm run cli -- autopsy 0xdeeb262fad28864a8e031db91e99de0bb4bd42aff936876d577adcddcf0de3ff
Autopsy (mainnet)  tx 0xdeeb262fad28864a8e031db91e99de0bb4bd42aff936876d577adcddcf0de3ff
Status:    failed (call-tree traced)
From:      0x7Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C
To:        0x69Dc8E2d95C3281a643810FB5624b26Da8610DA4
Block:     9740066
Gas used:  54908
Calls:     2 frame(s)
Failing:   0x7ac6d25f... -> 0x69dc8e2d... [0xc5918880] error=execute_revert
Revert:    BC
Cause:     contract reverted with: "BC"
```

The contract reverted with the short `Error(string)` message `"BC"`. Shield
reports it verbatim — it does not dress it up as a friendlier explanation it
cannot prove.

### Real example — signature DB names the call, but the revert stays honest

```text
$ npm run cli -- autopsy 0x3697e90417e7b9d4b7b5c2b32533583f9150d29853b2ff9a58db3db6e11cd22b
Status:    failed (call-tree traced)
Failing:   0xa4971a92... -> 0x7765b930... [fulfillBasicOrder_efficient_6GL6yc(...)] error=execute_revert
Revert:    custom error with selector 0x00000000 (no ABI available to decode its name)
Cause:     custom error 0x00000000 — not in the signature database; cause undetermined without the contract ABI
```

This single output shows both halves of the signature integration working — and
its honesty guard. The failing call's selector resolves through the openchain
signature DB to the real function `fulfillBasicOrder_efficient_6GL6yc(...)`. The
**revert** payload, however, is the degenerate `0x00000000` selector: it shares
that selector with named entries, but its bytes do **not** decode against any of
their argument types, so Shield refuses to apply a name and reports **cause
undetermined**. A coincidental selector collision never becomes a fabricated
error — naming is applied only when the arguments actually decode.

### Real example — a transaction that did NOT fail

```text
$ npm run cli -- autopsy 0xeae13982de30f5386625446d0c15218d5889c004391ff012afd33be7d4080c79
Status:    success
Cause:     transaction did NOT fail — it succeeded on chain.
Notes:
  - Receipt status = 1 (success). Nothing to diagnose.
```

### Cause mapping (how honest it is)

`probableCause` is only a category when the **decoded revert string** matches a
known pattern (e.g. contains `allowance`, `INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT`,
`paused`, a `Panic(0x11)` overflow). For a clear-but-unmapped message it echoes
the message verbatim; for empty/custom/undecodable data it returns *cause
undetermined*. It never asserts a cause the trace doesn't support.

---

## `simulate` — pre-flight dry-run

**What it does.** Builds a call object and runs `debug_traceCall` at the latest
block. It reports whether the call **would revert** (with the decoded reason),
the would-be **call tree**, and any **native PROS movements** derivable from the
trace. **It never sends a transaction.**

```
pharos-shield simulate --from <addr> [--to <addr>] [--data 0x..] [--value 1.0] [--gas N] [--json]
```

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--from` | ✅ | Sender. Pharos requires it for `debug_traceCall`. |
| `--to` | — | Target. Omit for a contract-creation simulation. |
| `--data` | — | Calldata hex (default `0x`). |
| `--value` | — | PROS to attach: decimal (`1.5`) or hex wei (`0x…`). |
| `--gas` | — | Gas limit: decimal or hex. |

### Use cases

- **Pre-sign safety on a swap.** Simulate the exact router call; if it would
  revert on `INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT`, you learn it for free instead of
  burning gas.
- **Verify an `approve` + `transferFrom` flow** behaves before submitting.
- **Confirm a withdrawal/claim isn't blocked** by a paused or frozen state in
  current chain conditions.
- **Read-only contract probing.** Simulate a `view`/`pure` call (`balanceOf`,
  `totalSupply`) to confirm a contract responds as expected.
- **Wallet / dApp "transaction preview".** Wire `--json` output into a UI to
  show users what a tx will do before they sign.

### Real example — would succeed

```text
$ npm run cli -- simulate \
    --from 0x7Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C \
    --to   0x52c48d4213107b20bc583832b0d951fb9ca8f0b0 \
    --data 0x70a082310000000000000000000000007Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C
Outcome:   would succeed
Calls:     1 frame(s)
Call tree:
  CALL -> 0x52c48d4213107b20bc583832b0d951fb9ca8f0b0 [balanceOf(address)]
Notes:
  - SIMULATION ONLY — no transaction was sent. Result reflects current latest-block state.
  - Would SUCCEED at the latest block (no top-level revert in the trace).
  - No non-zero native (PROS) movements in the trace.
```

### Real example — would revert

```text
$ npm run cli -- simulate --from 0x7Ac6d25... --to 0x52c48d... \
    --data 0xa9059cbb...   # transfer more than the balance
Outcome:   WOULD REVERT
Revert:    reverted with no return data (e.g. require without message, or a low-level revert)
Notes:
  - Would REVERT at the top level: reverted with no return data ...
  - Pharos reported the revert as an RPC error (no call tree returned for top-level reverts).
```

> **Pharos quirk (handled):** when the *top-level* call reverts, `debug_traceCall`
> returns a JSON-RPC error (code 3) with the revert payload in `error.data`
> rather than a trace frame. Shield catches this and presents it as a clean,
> decoded "would revert" outcome. Reverts in *inner* calls that the top frame
> catches still come back as a normal traced tree.

---

## Token movements & approval safety

Both `simulate` and `autopsy` decode **ERC-20/721 token movements and
approvals**, with token `symbol`/`decimals` resolved live via `eth_call`. This
is the pre-sign protection layer — and it stays **fact-based**: Shield reports
*what moves* and *what you're approving*, never a token "risk score."

Two honest sources:

| Command | Source of truth | Reports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autopsy` (succeeded tx) | actual `Transfer`/`Approval` **event logs** in the receipt | what really moved |
| `autopsy` (failed tx) | the reverted **call tree** | *attempted* movements (nothing actually moved) |
| `simulate` | the would-be **call tree** (or your own call if it'd revert) | *intended* movements before you sign |

### The headline: unlimited-approval detection

Approving `max uint256` (or `setApprovalForAll`) hands a spender the ability to
drain a token indefinitely — the most common way wallets get emptied. Shield
flags it as a **fact**, pre-sign. Real live simulation against a mainnet token:

```text
$ npm run cli -- simulate --from 0xf84d0A92... --to 0x52C48d42...(WPROS) \
    --data 0x095ea7b3<spender>ffffffff…ffff   # approve(spender, MAX)
Outcome:   would succeed
Approvals (intended):
  owner 0xf84d0A92... grants 0xBF105f4f...: UNLIMITED (max uint256) [WPROS]  ⚠ UNLIMITED
Notes:
  - Approval grants 0xBF105f4f... an UNLIMITED allowance on WPROS.
```

`isUnlimited` (exact `max uint256`), `isVeryLarge` (≥ 2²⁵⁵), and `operatorAll`
(`setApprovalForAll`) are all surfaced in the JSON for programmatic gating.

### Real movements from a succeeded swap

`autopsy` on a real successful tx decodes every `Transfer` with symbols and
decimals applied:

```text
$ npm run cli -- autopsy 0xeae13982de30f5386625446d0c15218d5889c004391ff012afd33be7d4080c79
Status:    success
Token movements:
  0xBE47a90c... -> 0x4fD44181...: 2.5 USDC [USDC]
  0x912c9aDe... -> 0xA5cA5Fbe...: 4.215035862018449767 WPROS [WPROS]
  0x4fD44181... -> 0x912c9aDe...: 2.5 USDC [USDC]
  0xA5cA5Fbe... -> 0x903cF528...: 0.006322553793027674 WPROS [WPROS]
Notes:
  - Token activity (from event logs): 4 transfer(s), 0 approval(s).
```

### Honest scope

- Amounts use real on-chain `decimals()`/`symbol()`; if a token doesn't answer,
  the raw base-unit amount is shown and labeled `decimals unknown` — never faked.
- `transferFrom` shares one selector across ERC-20 and ERC-721 (identical
  signature), so its value is reported without asserting amount-vs-tokenId.
- For a **failed** tx, movements are clearly labeled **ATTEMPTED** — nothing
  moved, because it reverted.
- This is movement/approval *accounting*, not honeypot/tax detection. No scoring.

---

## `probe` — capability check

Reports the active network, RPC URL, and a **live** check of whether the
`debug_*` trace namespace is enabled. Run it first when pointing Shield at a new
RPC.

```text
$ npm run cli -- probe
Network:  mainnet (chain 1672)
RPC:      https://rpc.pharos.xyz
Trace:    traceCall=true traceTransaction=true
Note:     debug_traceCall(callTracer) responded; trace namespace is enabled.
```

---

## Composable workflows

The three commands share one core and chain naturally:

**1. Failure → control structure.** A tx failed at a contract you don't
recognize. Autopsy it, then inspect the failing `to` address to see if it's a
proxy whose implementation explains the behavior:

```bash
npm run cli -- autopsy 0x<failed-tx>          # -> Failing: ... -> 0xCONTRACT [selector]
npm run cli -- inspect 0xCONTRACT             # -> proxy? impl? admin?
```

**2. Pre-sign → diagnose.** Simulate a call; if it would revert, you already
have the decoded reason. If you sent it anyway and it failed, autopsy confirms
the same cause from the mined tx.

**3. Due diligence → preview.** Inspect a contract to learn it's an upgradeable
proxy, then simulate your intended call against it to see current behavior
before committing.

**Scripting it (`--json`).** Every command supports `--json`; pipe into `jq`:

```bash
# Is the failing address a proxy?
TX=0xdeeb262fad28864a8e031db91e99de0bb4bd42aff936876d577adcddcf0de3ff
TO=$(npm run -s cli -- autopsy "$TX" --json | jq -r '.failingCall.to')
npm run -s cli -- inspect "$TO" --json | jq '{kind, proxy}'
```

## Suggested demo (≈90 s)

A four-step walkthrough that exercises all three commands against **real
mainnet** state — no setup beyond `npm install`:

```bash
# 1. Confirm you're on mainnet and tracing is live (~5s)
npm run cli -- probe
#    -> Network: mainnet (chain 1672); Trace: traceCall=true traceTransaction=true

# 2. Autopsy a real failed transaction — get the decoded revert (~10s)
npm run cli -- autopsy 0xdeeb262fad28864a8e031db91e99de0bb4bd42aff936876d577adcddcf0de3ff
#    -> Status: failed; Revert: "BC"; Cause: contract reverted with: "BC"

# 3. Inspect the contract that reverted — is it a proxy? (~5s)
npm run cli -- inspect 0x69Dc8E2d95C3281a643810FB5624b26Da8610DA4
#    -> contract (19020 bytes); Proxy: no — fixed logic, no upgrade slots set

# 4. Pre-flight a call before signing — would it revert? (~10s)
npm run cli -- simulate \
  --from 0x7Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C \
  --to   0x52c48d4213107b20bc583832b0d951fb9ca8f0b0 \
  --data 0x18160ddd          # totalSupply()
#    -> Outcome: would succeed; Call tree printed
```

**The story it tells:** an agent diagnoses *why* a transaction failed (decoded
on-chain reason), investigates the *control structure* of the contract involved,
and *pre-flights* the next call before a single unit of gas is spent — all from
verifiable on-chain facts, never a safety guess.

## Using Shield from an AI agent (MCP)

The same core is exposed as MCP tools so any MCP-compatible agent can call Shield
natively. The MCP layer is a **thin adapter** over the exact `scripts/` core —
no logic is reimplemented.

| MCP tool | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shield_inspect` | `{ address }` | inspect result (JSON) |
| `shield_autopsy` | `{ txhash }` | autopsy result (JSON) |
| `shield_simulate` | `{ from, to?, data?, value?, gas? }` | simulate result (JSON) |
| `shield_probe` | `{}` | network + live trace capability |

### Talk to it in plain English from any agent CLI

Once connected, you don't call the tools by hand — you ask the agent in natural
language and it routes to the right tool:

| You say… | Agent calls |
| --- | --- |
| "is `0x3c22…cf62` a proxy, and who can upgrade it?" | `shield_inspect` |
| "why did tx `0xdeeb…e3ff` fail?" | `shield_autopsy` |
| "dry-run this call before I sign it" | `shield_simulate` |
| "is the Pharos trace API live right now?" | `shield_probe` |

Print ready-to-paste config for your CLI (paths resolved automatically):

```bash
npm run setup
```

**Install the binary once**, then every CLI refers to it by name — no path, no
`tsx`. `npm install` builds `dist/` automatically (via `prepare`):

```bash
npm install -g .        # or: npm link   → exposes `pharos-shield-mcp`
```

Once published to npm, the same works zero-clone: `npx -y pharos-shield-mcp`.

**Claude Code** — a project-scoped `.mcp.json` is committed at the package root,
so just open the folder and approve the `pharos-shield` server. To register it
globally instead:

```bash
claude mcp add pharos-shield -- pharos-shield-mcp
```

**Codex CLI** — add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.pharos-shield]
command = "pharos-shield-mcp"
env = { PHAROS_NETWORK = "mainnet" }
```

**Cursor / Windsurf / any MCP client** — standard `mcpServers` JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pharos-shield": {
      "command": "pharos-shield-mcp",
      "env": { "PHAROS_NETWORK": "mainnet" }
    }
  }
}
```

No global install? Use `"command": "node", "args": ["/abs/path/pharos-shield/dist/mcp/server.js"]`
(run `npm run build` first), or the in-repo dev form with `--import tsx mcp/server.ts`.

Run the server directly (for testing or HTTP transport):

```bash
npm run mcp            # stdio transport (editors / desktop agents)
npm run mcp:http       # Streamable HTTP on http://127.0.0.1:8731/mcp
#   custom port:  node --import tsx mcp/server.ts --http --port 9000
```

Both transports were tested end-to-end against mainnet (initialize → tools/list
→ tools/call returns real on-chain data). An agent should route user intent to a
tool using the [decision table above](#which-command-do-i-want), then read the
JSON fields described next.

## Output reference (JSON fields)

Use `--json` for these shapes (text mode is a formatted view of the same data).

### `inspect`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `"contract"` \| `"eoa"` | bytecode present or not |
| `codeSize` | number | deployed bytecode size in bytes (0 for EOA) |
| `proxy.isProxy` | boolean | any proxy slot/pattern detected |
| `proxy.standard` | `eip1967` \| `eip1967-beacon` \| `legacy-oz` \| `eip1167-minimal` \| `none` | detected pattern |
| `proxy.implementation` | address? | current logic contract |
| `proxy.admin` | address? | EIP-1967 admin (upgrade authority) |
| `proxy.beacon` | address? | beacon contract (beacon proxies) |
| `proxy.beaconImplementation` | address? | impl resolved via `beacon.implementation()` |
| `upgradeAuthority` | string | inferred-from-storage description |
| `bytecode` | object? | `{ opcodes[], hasDelegateCall, hasSelfDestruct, hasCreate2 }` |
| `traits` | object? | live `{ owner?, paused?, implementation? }` |
| `token` | object? | `{ name?, symbol?, decimals?, totalSupply? }` |
| `interfaces` | string[]? | ERC-165 interfaces declared (e.g. `ERC-721`) |
| `notes` | string[] | the facts behind the verdict |

### `autopsy`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `found` | boolean | tx exists on this network |
| `status` | `success` \| `failed` \| `unknown` | receipt status |
| `traced` | boolean | results came from a real call-tree trace |
| `failingCall` | object? | `{ from, to, selector, value, error, depthPath }` |
| `revert.kind` | `Error` \| `Panic` \| `custom` \| `empty` \| `raw` | revert encoding |
| `revert.reason` | string | decoded reason or faithful description |
| `revert.selector` | string? | 4-byte selector of the revert payload |
| `revert.signature` | string? | custom-error signature resolved via the signature DB (only when its args decode) |
| `revert.args` | string[]? | decoded custom-error arguments, when resolvable |
| `tokens` | object? | `{ transfers[], approvals[], notes[] }` (see below) |
| `probableCause` | string | trace-supported cause or "cause undetermined" |

### `simulate`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isSimulation` | `true` | always — Shield never sends |
| `willRevert` | boolean | top-level revert in the trace |
| `revert` | object? | decoded revert (same shape as autopsy) |
| `calls` | array | flattened call tree: `{ type, from, to, selector, value, errored, depth }` |
| `nativeMovements` | array | `{ from, to, pros }` non-zero native transfers |
| `tokens` | object | `{ transfers[], approvals[], notes[] }` (see below) |
| `callCount` | number | frames in the tree |

### `tokens` (shared by `simulate` & `autopsy`)

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `transfers[]` | array | `{ token, symbol?, standard, from, to, amount, source }` |
| `approvals[]` | array | `{ token, symbol?, standard, owner, spender, amount, isUnlimited, isVeryLarge, operatorAll, source }` |
| `notes[]` | string[] | factual flags (e.g. "grants … an UNLIMITED allowance on WPROS") |

`source` is `"log"` (real event, succeeded tx) or `"call"` (decoded from a call
tree — intended/attempted). `amount` is decimals-formatted with `symbol` when
the token answers, else raw base units labeled `decimals unknown`.

---

## Building calldata for `simulate`

`--data` is raw calldata. The quickest way to build it is ethers:

```bash
node -e '
const { Interface } = require("ethers");
const i = new Interface(["function transfer(address,uint256)"]);
console.log(i.encodeFunctionData("transfer", [
  "0x7Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C",
  1000000000000000000n
]));
'
# 0xa9059cbb...  -> pass to:  simulate --from 0x.. --to 0xToken --data 0xa9059cbb...
```

Common read selectors you can paste directly: `balanceOf(address)` =
`0x70a08231` + 32-byte-padded address; `totalSupply()` = `0x18160ddd`;
`decimals()` = `0x313ce567`.

---

## Current build verification

Verified **2026-06-09** against live Pharos mainnet (latest block ≈ 9,741,966 at
the time of this run), Node v24, ethers v6:

```text
$ npx tsc --noEmit
tsc --noEmit: clean (exit 0)          # strict + exactOptionalPropertyTypes

$ npx tsc && node dist/scripts/cli.js inspect 0x7Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C
Kind:      eoa                        # compiled binary runs, not just type-checks

$ npm run cli -- probe
Network:  mainnet (chain 1672)
RPC:      https://rpc.pharos.xyz
Trace:    traceCall=true traceTransaction=true
Note:     debug_traceCall(callTracer) responded; trace namespace is enabled.
```

MCP transports were exercised end-to-end the same day: `initialize` →
`tools/list` (returns `shield_inspect`, `shield_autopsy`, `shield_simulate`,
`shield_probe`) → `tools/call` returning real on-chain data, over **both** stdio
and Streamable HTTP. `npm audit` reports 2 moderate advisories in the dev
toolchain (transitive); no runtime-path impact.

---

## Verified on-chain artifacts

Every example in this README resolves to a **real Pharos mainnet (chain 1672)**
artifact. These are the exact addresses and transaction hashes used, and what
each one proves:

**Transactions (for `autopsy`):**

| Tx hash | Block | Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0xdeeb262f…cf0de3ff` | 9,740,066 | failed tx; decoded `Error(string)` = `"BC"` |
| `0x3697e904…e11cd22b` | 9,740,065 | failed tx; non-standard revert → "cause undetermined" |
| `0xeae13982…d4080c79` | 9,739,680 | **successful** swap → 4 real ERC-20 `Transfer`s decoded (USDC/WPROS) |
| `0x9ff066f3…dccf2264` | 9,742,305 | real `approve()` tx → `Approval` event decoded (revoke, amount 0) |

**Addresses (for `inspect`):**

| Address | Classification | Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x3c2269811836af69497E5F486A85D7316753cf62` | EIP-1967 proxy | impl `0x4EE2F9B7…`, admin `0x9740FF91…`, live `owner()` `0x9F40…`, bytecode `DELEGATECALL` |
| `0x28b5a0e9C621a5BadaA536219b3a228C8168cf5d` | EIP-1967 proxy | impl `0x1CcaFdff…`, admin `0x334eaBb5…` |
| `0x52C48d4213107b20bC583832b0d951FB9CA8F0B0` | non-proxy token | `Wrapped PROS (WPROS)`, decimals 18 (live reads) |
| `0x7Ac6d25FD5E437cB7c57Aee77aC2d0A6Cb85936C` | EOA | `eth_getCode` → `0x` |

> **Read-only by design.** Shield never broadcasts a transaction, so there is no
> "write path" to verify — `simulate` uses `debug_traceCall` and the other two
> commands are pure reads. That is a deliberate safety property, not a gap.

## Verified-vs-degraded status

Everything here was probed against live Pharos mainnet on 2026-06-09.

| Capability | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mainnet RPC `https://rpc.pharos.xyz` | **Confirmed** | `eth_chainId` → `0x688` (1672) |
| `debug_traceTransaction` (callTracer) | **Confirmed** | Returns a call frame for real failed txs (see autopsy examples) |
| `debug_traceCall` (callTracer) | **Confirmed** | Returns a frame; requires a `from` field |
| `eth_getCode` / `eth_getStorageAt` | **Confirmed** | EIP-1967 slot reads verified against real proxies |
| Top-level revert behavior | **Confirmed quirk** | `debug_traceCall` returns JSON-RPC error code 3 with revert data in `error.data` (handled) |
| Explorer source-verification API | **Not available** | `pharosscan.xyz` sits behind a bot wall and exposes no Etherscan/Blockscout-style source API. `inspect` is therefore scoped to storage-provable facts; it does **not** claim "verified source". |
| Testnet (688688) public RPC | **Unconfirmed** | No public trace-enabled testnet RPC reachable from a clean environment at build time. Override with `PHAROS_TESTNET_RPC`. |
| Pharos Agent Center / Anvita Flow MCP ingestion | **Unconfirmed** | The hackathon portal could not be inspected programmatically. Shield ships **both** a SKILL.md directory and an MCP server so it works regardless of which the Agent Center ingests. |

### Graceful degradation

If a configured RPC lacks the `debug_*` namespace, `autopsy` falls back to
receipt + revert-reason level (via a historical `eth_call`) and labels the
result **degraded**. `simulate` requires `debug_traceCall`; if it is absent the
command reports that honestly rather than faking a trace.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `probe` shows `traceCall=false` | RPC has `debug_*` disabled | Point `PHAROS_MAINNET_RPC` at a trace-enabled endpoint |
| `autopsy` says `Status: NOT FOUND` | Wrong network or wrong hash | Check the hash; confirm `PHAROS_NETWORK` matches the tx's chain |
| `autopsy` shows `degraded: no trace available` | Trace namespace unavailable on this RPC | Use a trace-enabled RPC; receipt-level facts are still reported |
| `simulate` errors with `from is needed` | `--from` omitted | Pharos requires a sender for `debug_traceCall`; pass `--from` |
| `inspect` shows `kind: eoa` for a "contract" | Address has no bytecode | Verify the address; it may be a typo or an EOA |
| Revert shows `custom error 0x…` | Selector not in the signature DB, or its bytes don't decode against any candidate | Expected — Shield reports the raw selector rather than guessing a name it can't confirm |

---

## Network configuration

| Network | Chain ID | Default RPC | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mainnet (default) | 1672 | `https://rpc.pharos.xyz` | verified |
| testnet | 688688 | `https://testnet.dplabs-internal.com` | unconfirmed (override via env) |

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

- `PHAROS_NETWORK` — `mainnet` (default) or `testnet`
- `PHAROS_MAINNET_RPC` / `PHAROS_TESTNET_RPC` — override RPC URLs
- `PHAROS_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS` — request timeout (default 20000)

---

## Safety & honesty policy

1. **Facts, not verdicts.** Shield never emits SAFE/UNSAFE. It reports decoded
   reverts, proven proxy/admin slots, and simulation outcomes.
2. **No mocks, ever.** Every output comes from a real RPC call. Unavailable
   capabilities are degraded and labeled, never faked.
3. **Mainnet is the source of truth.** Every example here is mainnet (1672).
4. **Pre-flight is read-only.** `simulate` uses `debug_traceCall`; it never
   broadcasts a transaction.
